LCKNNWrongArgsError =  Wrong input parameter format when launching the \
LC k-Nearest Neighbors (LCKNN) algorithm. Error in {0}
LCKNNWrongArgsValuesError = Check the parameters' values. Remember that:\
\n \t -k must be positive.\
\n \t -c must be positive.\
\n \t -h must be positive.\
\n \t -z must be positive.\
\n \t -t must be 0 or 1.\
\n \t -l must be positive.\
\n \t -i must be positive.\
\n \t -s must be positive.
LCKNNPossibleArgs = Possible arguments are:\
\n \t -k + int \t Number of nearest neighbors\
\n \t -c + int \t Number clusters to use.\
\n \t -l + int \t Number of landmarks to use.\
\n \t -i + int \t Number of iterations for k-means algorithm.\
\n \t -h + double \t Bandwidth of the kernel function.\
\n \t -z + int \t Nearest neighbours to set to non-zero value on \u1E90 matrix.\
\n \t -t + int \t Algorithm to produce landmarks: 0 (random) and 1 (k-means).\
\n \t -s + int \t Seed for random computations.
LCKNNNoNumberError = I was expecting a number but I got {0}
LCKNNPairNumberParamError =  I was expecting a pair number of arguments in {0}
